So yeah, i'm in Berlin, waiting for the <a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/">Bratwurst</a> and i just remembered that it's really cool to say stuff like "I went to &lt;x city&gt; and hacked on &lt;y project&gt;". 
</p>
<p>
I was going to say something clever but the gist of it is that i found this code, it does stuff, and it makes tribby look like a thing with bars. And as everybody knows, bars are aweseome.
