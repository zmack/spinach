Annoyingly enough, i looked for this for the better part of 20 minutes, so i'm just going to make a note of it here, so that the next time i forget it i can safely feel like a huge tit when the search leads me to my own vegetable-rich blog.

<code>
Merb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do
  # Add dependencies here that must load after the application loads:
  # dependency "magic_admin" # this gem uses the app's model classes
  DataObjects::Sqlite3.logger = DataObjects::Logger.new(STDOUT, 0)
end
</code>

The class obviously changes if you're using a different database

P.S.: Future-me, if you're reading this, you're an enormous twat. That is all
