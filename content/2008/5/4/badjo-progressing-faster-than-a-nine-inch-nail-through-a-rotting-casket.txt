<p>Been hacking away at this for a couple of days, and this is pretty much where i'm at currently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gravatars get shown ( yay )</li>
<li>Added project details when clicking on a repo ( have to add some sort of transition thingy but right now i can't think of a decent one so right now the text just magically appears )</li>
<li>Made the whole thing fully resizable</li>
<li>Scrolling for the project list ( the white circles control it - rubbish, i know, but MAGIC ! )</li>
</ul>
<p>
So here's a quick look at what's what, and seeing as <a href="http://evil.che.lu">Cristi</a> let me know that i apparently stole <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com">Nic</a>'s son's name, this demo is entirely dedicated to him !
