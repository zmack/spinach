<p>To put things quite succinctly, my name is Andrei Bocan, i live in the lovely city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest">Bucharest</a> and i use my nimble fingers to write pretty ruby code. Said fingers are also used to write Javascript and CSS, but to a lesser extent. In a past life, aforementioned digits also wrote PHP, but they're trying to block out those memories.
