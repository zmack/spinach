While carefully constructing the friendly about section earlier today, I noticed that, should an article fail to receive any tags, it would be left with an annoying "Tags:" text and, misleadingly enough, no tags. This makes various baby animals the world over quite sad indeed, so it must be fixed.
<br/>
My first idea was to dive into the layout and try something to the tune of :
<pre>
<code>
{% unless article.tags.empty? %} Tags: {{ article | linked_tag_list }}{% endunless %}
</code>
</pre>

While this did not actually do anything useful, it did bring to light the fact that my understanding of liquid is laughable, at best. Grep safely in hand, i went deeper and came across this lovely piece of code in 'app\drops\article_drop.rb':
<pre>
<code>
def initialize(source, options = {})
    super source
    @options  = options
    @liquid.update \
      'body'            => @source.body_html,
      'excerpt'         => (@source.excerpt_html.blank? ? nil : @source.excerpt_html),
      'accept_comments' => @source.accept_comments?,
      'is_page_home'    => (options[:page] == true)
  end
</code>
</pre>

Being the horrible person that I am, I added 
<pre>
<code>
'tagged'          => !@source.tags.empty?,
</code>
</pre>

Luckily enough, the universe didn't collapse and i could now use
<pre>
<code>
{% if article.tagged %} Tags: {{ article | linked_tag_list }}{% endif %}
</code>
</pre>
<br/>
Please note that if anybody tries making sense and pointing out that there is no sane reason why an article wouldn't be tagged, i will make up at least 20 reasons, one of which will involve string theories and pandas. You have been warned.

Thanks to <a href="http://evil.che.lu/">Cristi</a> i now know what the right way to go about the above problem would have been, namely
<pre>
<code>
{% unless article.tags == empty %} Tags: {{ article | linked_tag_list }}{% endunless %}
</code>
</pre>
