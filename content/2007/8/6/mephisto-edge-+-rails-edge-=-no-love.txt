After postponing putting up a blog about my many and diverse ruby adventures, i finally sat down for a couple of minutes and put this up. 

Going through the regular motions of installing mephisto, it all seemed ok until i tried to log into the admin account. Then - disaster !
Mephisto died mercilessly stating that 

<pre>
<code>
NoMethodError (undefined method `extract_options_from_args!' for #<Class:0x2aaaf9b8a668>)
</code>
</pre>

After some grepping i found the function in activerecord base, in an earlier version of rails :

<pre>
<code>
def extract_options_from_args!(args) #:nodoc:
  args.last.is_a?(Hash) ? args.pop : {}
end
</code>
</pre>

The whole thing originates in the acts_as_paranoid plugin, so basically you can either patch that with the function definition, replace the call to the function, or just be a horrible human being and patch your edge rails with the function. Whichever way you choose to take, it should fix the issue. 
<br/><br/>
<i>Later edit</i><br/>
As BradC points out, the intended replacement for extract_options_from_args! is args.extract_options!. As such, replacing line 75 of paranoid.rb to
<pre>
<code>
options = args.extract_options!
</code>
</pre>
would not make you a horrible person, quite on the contrary, it would make you a lovely one !
